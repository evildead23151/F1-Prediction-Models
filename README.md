#🏎️ F1 Race Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the F1 Race Predictor repository!
This project uses machine learning to predict outcomes of Formula 1 Grand Prix races based on historical data, driver/team stats, and real-time race conditions.

> 🚀 The first deployed model is based on Gradient Boosting, with many more models to follow.

#🔮 Goals

This project aims to:

Build predictive ML models for F1 race outcomes (winner, podiums, points).

Explore various algorithms:

Gradient Boosting ✅

Random Forest 🌱

XGBoost ⚡

Neural Networks 🧠

Ensemble Blending 🔁


Deploy top models via web interface or APIs.

Track feature importances: track type, weather, driver, team form, qualifying position.
